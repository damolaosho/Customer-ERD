Database Schema
The database employs a well-structured schema with interconnected tables, fostering relationships between entities. 
From one-to-many relationships, such as customers placing multiple orders, to many-to-one relationships, like associating images with specific products, the schema is designed to reflect the complex interactions within your online store ecosystem.
